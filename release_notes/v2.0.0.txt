Breaking Changes
---------------------

CR https://gerrit.hyperledger.org/r/#/c/29360/ delivers breaking changes to the key-value stores and Cryptosuite classes:
 - Key-value stores no longer initialize the store within the constructor; there is a seperate (async) `initialize` method that contains the initialize logic.
 - Cryptosuite interface is now strictly followed. The `generateKey` method within implementations no longer accepts `ephemeral: true` as an option; the `generateEphemeralKey` method should be used to retrive an ephemeral key.
